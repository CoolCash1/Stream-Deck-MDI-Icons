## How to use
To download the icons, just visit the 
[releases page](https://github.com/CoolCash1/Stream-Deck-MDI-Icons/releases/tag/release) 
and download the latest. 

## Building icons
The icons are pulled directly from Google's github then 
overlayed onto pre-defined icons with FFMPEG. To build 
your own icons, please install Python. To install 
FFMPEG, download a prebuild binary from the 
[FFMPEG Website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and then add 
it to your systems path variable. Just run the build.bat 
file and the icons will be built automatically! When
building your own icons, you also have the choice to edit
the base/background icon for more customization.

## Contributing
I will only accept contributions on the building system 
and the following files:
- .gitignore
- Readme(s)

If you find a critical error elsewere, feel free to
submit a PR, I might just accept it.

If you want to contribute to the icons themselves, 
please visit 
[Googles Material Design Icons Github](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).
